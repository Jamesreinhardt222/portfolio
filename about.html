          <p>
            Born in New York, I moved to Vancouver Island when I was very
            little. My parents are bike mechanics, so I spent most of my
            childhood mountain biking. You can often find me hanging out by the
            river with my friends.

          <p>
            I'm currently studying software development in BCIT's computer
            systems technology program. It is a very hands-on, practical program
            that focuses on real-world skills such as agile-development,
            professional documentation, and industry-standard programming
            practices.

          <h6>Combined major in Biology and psychology</h6>
          <p>
            Being well-rounded is important to me, so I took courses in
            philosophy, genetics, biochemistry, computer science, psychology,
            and Batman Studies (my favourite). I got my first taste of
            programming by using R to run statistical tests. I volunteered at
            hospitals and psych wards during my time there, and after graduating
            I went to work at a homeless shelter.

          <p>
            I wanted research experience for medical school, so I worked for
            Blue Coast Research in Parksville. Their software development team
            creates computer-generated models of underground gold and silver
            mines. I would measure the particle size distribution of samples and
            prepare them for further analysis to find out their gold and silver
            content.
